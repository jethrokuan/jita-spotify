# Jita - Play along with songs on Spotify

![screenshot](docs/jita.png)

Jita is a simple web application that shows the tab for the currently playing
song on Spotify. It also provides a rudimentary auto-scroll functionality that
scrolls the page based on the song's current playing progress, allowing the user
to play along to songs without ever touching the app.
